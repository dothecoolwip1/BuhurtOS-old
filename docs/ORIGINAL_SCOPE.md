# BuhurtOS Original Product Scope

This document is the authoritative baseline for BuhurtOS. It consolidates the original BuhurtOS planning decisions recovered from prior project discussions and should be used as the acceptance checklist for future implementation.

## Product Goal

BuhurtOS is not only a bracket or scoring app. It is intended to be a complete, mobile-first operating system for running Buhurt organizations, seasons, events, fighters, teams, marshals, scoring, live spectators, registration, compliance, standings, discipline, and event operations.

The product should be HACSA-first while remaining multi-organization and globally scalable.

## Platform and Architecture

- Mobile-first PWA
- PC, Android, iPhone and tablet compatible
- Offline-capable field workflows
- Local persistence for unsynced work
- Queued writes and background synchronization
- Conflict-safe recovery for simultaneous marshal use
- Realtime updates
- Supabase/PostgreSQL/Auth/Realtime/Storage/RLS backend
- UTC timestamps with local timezone conversion
- Internationalization/localization-ready
- Multi-tenant organization isolation
- Audit logging from Day 1
- Future payment/subscription readiness
- No fragile drag-and-drop for critical field controls

## Organization, Team, Captain, and Member Self-Service

BuhurtOS must support a delegated organization and team management model so HACSA does not need to manually maintain every team and fighter.

### Organization-controlled team creation

Authorized organization administrators must be able to:

- Create new teams inside their organization
- Approve or disable teams
- Assign or replace team captains
- Maintain team status, region, logo, public description, colours, links, and contact information
- View team rosters and tournament participation
- Transfer team administration when leadership changes
- Preserve historical team records even when a team is renamed or leadership changes

Teams remain owned by the organization, not by an individual captain account.

### Team captain roster management

Authorized team captains must be able to:

- Invite existing BuhurtOS members to join their team
- Invite people who do not yet have a BuhurtOS account
- Add temporary or pending members
- Remove members from the active roster without deleting historical records
- Assign member roles where permitted
- Review team membership requests
- Confirm or reject team affiliation requests
- Manage team tournament lineups
- Add guest or mercenary fighters for an event
- See fighter eligibility and event registration status
- Never gain access to private information belonging to another team

Team membership changes must be auditable and historical membership periods should be preserved.

### Member and fighter self-service profiles

Every member should be able to maintain their own personal profile without requiring a captain or HACSA administrator to edit it for them.

Self-service profile fields should support:

- Display name
- Legal name where required for private administrative use
- Fighter name / nickname
- Profile photo
- Additional gallery photos
- Biography
- Home region
- Team affiliation
- Preferred weapons / divisions
- Height and weight where the fighter chooses to provide them and where appropriate
- Social links
- Achievements
- Experience
- Certifications or qualifications where relevant
- Emergency/medical information only where specifically required, with strict private access controls
- Public/private visibility settings for individual profile fields

Members must be able to upload, replace, reorder, and remove their own profile photos.

### Public fighter profiles

A fighter may choose to expose a public sports profile containing appropriate information such as:

- Profile photo
- Fighter name
- Team
- Region
- Categories competed in
- Career record
- Season record
- Tournament history
- Placements and podiums
- Upcoming public events
- Achievements
- Public biography
- Selected public photos

Private contact, waiver, medical, emergency, login, and administrative information must never appear on the public profile.

### Identity and historical integrity

The fighter account, fighter record, and team membership must remain separate concepts.

A fighter changing teams must not create a new fighter identity or reset their career history.

Historical results must continue to show the team the fighter represented at the time of the event while the current profile may show their current team.

Temporary/ghost fighters must be mergeable into a permanent member profile without losing past match, bracket, discipline, or standings references.

### Suggested onboarding flow

1. HACSA or another authorized organization creates/approves a team.
2. The organization assigns one or more team captains.
3. A captain invites members by email or shareable invite link.
4. The member creates/signs into their BuhurtOS account.
5. The member builds their personal fighter profile and uploads photos.
6. The member accepts the team invitation.
7. The captain confirms the roster relationship where required.
8. The fighter can register for events and their future results attach to the same permanent fighter record.

This delegated model is a core product requirement for BuhurtOS.


## Governing Bodies and Federation Hierarchy

BuhurtOS must support governing bodies above individual organizations so it can represent the real sport hierarchy instead of treating every organization as a top-level tenant.

### Required hierarchy

A flexible hierarchy should support:

- International governing body / federation
- National governing body
- Regional or provincial/state governing organization
- Local organization or club association
- Team
- Team captain(s)
- Member / fighter

One possible example may look like:

International federation or rules authority (for example BI, IMCF, or another body)
→ National governing organization
→ HACSA or another regional/organizational body
→ Red Deer Reavers
→ Team captains
→ Fighters

This is an example relationship only. BuhurtOS must not require every organization to sit beneath BI or any single federation.

The hierarchy must remain configurable because different countries and rule systems may organize the sport differently.

### Governing body capabilities

Higher-level governing bodies should be able to:

- Create or recognize subordinate organizations
- Approve or suspend subordinate organizations where appropriate
- Publish official rulesets
- Define sanctioned competition classes/divisions
- Define ranking systems
- Define season structures
- Define championship qualification rules
- Sanction events
- View sanctioned event results
- Maintain official fighter/team records across subordinate organizations
- Maintain discipline and suspension records within their jurisdiction
- Publish official announcements
- Maintain governance metadata, branding, region/country, links, and contacts
- Delegate administrative authority to subordinate organizations without giving them access to unrelated organizations

### Ruleset inheritance

Rules should be inheritable through the hierarchy.

For example:

BI ruleset
→ national override/addendum
→ HACSA override/addendum
→ event-specific configuration

Lower levels may only override fields explicitly allowed by the parent governing body.

Every match/result must preserve the exact ruleset/version used at the time so historical results remain reproducible even after rules change.

### Sanctioning and event authority

Events should be able to reference:

- Governing body
- Sanctioning organization
- Host organization
- Participating teams
- Ruleset/version
- Ranking/standings eligibility
- Championship/qualifier status
- Official event classification

This allows a tournament to be hosted by one organization while being sanctioned by a higher governing body.

### Identity across governing bodies

Teams and fighters must have permanent BuhurtOS identities that can participate across multiple governing bodies without duplicate profiles.

A fighter may:

- Belong to one current team
- Hold memberships in multiple governing bodies
- Compete in events sanctioned by different organizations
- Carry one career history across all compatible events
- Have rankings that are jurisdiction-specific where necessary

Historical results must preserve the organization/team represented at the time of competition.

### Multi-organization data visibility

Higher-level administrators may view data inside their jurisdiction according to permission and privacy rules.

A subordinate organization must never automatically gain access to sibling organizations' private data.

Public competition records can be aggregated upward for rankings, history, and spectator views without exposing private administrative or medical information.


## Federation-Agnostic Governance and Independent Rulesets

BuhurtOS must never hard-code Buhurt International, IMCF, HACSA, or any other federation as the permanent root of the product.

The platform must support multiple current, historical, future, and local governing bodies side by side.

Examples may include:

- Buhurt International (BI)
- IMCF
- National governing bodies
- Regional associations
- Provincial/state organizations
- Independent leagues
- Local tournament organizations
- Future federations that do not exist yet

A governing body may become inactive, merge, rename, split, or cease operating without breaking historical records.

### Governing bodies are not the same thing as rulesets

Rulesets must be separate versioned entities from organizations.

A governing body may publish one or more rulesets.

An organization may recognize or adopt rulesets published by another body.

An event may select a specific ruleset and version regardless of the host organization's place in the governance hierarchy.

For example:

- BI Rules 2027
- IMCF Historical Rules 2025
- HACSA Rules 2027
- HACSA Rules based on BI with local amendments
- Local exhibition rules
- Custom event rules

### Ruleset records

Every ruleset should support:

- Name
- Publisher / governing body
- Version
- Effective date
- Retirement date
- Status: draft, active, superseded, historical
- Supported competition formats
- Scoring definitions
- Penalties/cards
- Equipment/armor requirements where appropriate
- Match timing
- Round structure
- Advancement rules
- Tie-breaking
- Ranking eligibility
- Allowed local overrides
- Source/reference documents
- Structured machine-readable configuration
- Human-readable explanation for fighters, marshals, and spectators

Completed matches must retain an immutable reference to the exact ruleset version used.

### Organization relationships must be flexible

The governance model should not rely on one permanent strict tree.

BuhurtOS should support relationships such as:

- affiliated with
- sanctioned by
- recognized by
- member of
- regional body of
- national body of
- rules adopted from
- historical predecessor/successor

This allows the database to represent real-world changes without rewriting history.

### Historical organizations

If a governing body or organization becomes inactive:

- Its historical events remain accessible
- Its rulesets remain available for old results
- Its fighter and team records remain linked correctly
- It can be marked inactive/historical rather than deleted
- Successor organizations may be linked without replacing the original historical entity

The same principle applies to renamed, merged, dissolved, or replaced organizations.


## Primary HACSA Hierarchy

For the primary HACSA implementation, BuhurtOS should model the normal chain as:

Buhurt International (BI)
→ HACSA
→ Team
→ Fighter / Member

Example:

BI
→ HACSA
→ Red Deer Reavers
→ Bob

In this model:

- BI is the parent governing body / federation
- HACSA is the organization operating beneath BI
- Red Deer Reavers is a team belonging to HACSA
- Bob is a fighter/member belonging to the Red Deer Reavers
- Team captains manage the relationship between the team and its members
- Fighters manage their own personal profiles
- Historical results preserve the exact team and organization represented at the time

The data model should optimize the first implementation around this BI → HACSA → Team → Fighter path while remaining capable of supporting other federations and structures later.
